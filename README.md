# Spotify - Replica web-app

**Initial commit**: 22/02/23

**Tecnologie:** HTML, CSS, Flex e @media-query.

**Info**: ðŸŽµ Meet Spotify, my first web app for Boolean. 
Also in this exercise, the media queries and the Mobile First approach gave me a hand in managing the responsive layout, furthermore, through the vh and vw we fixed the sidebar on the left, the media player at the bottom, and made the main scrollable.
